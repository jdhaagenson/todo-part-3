# Overview

Convert your Todo App to using Redux. Redux is an alternative to passing props through several layers of child components in order to get data where you need it to be. The goal of this assessment will be to refactor your app so that your application's state is in a Redux store instead of in your App component's state.

In this assessment, you will demonstrate a basic understanding of the following:

- mapStateToProps
- mapDispatchToProps
- Actions / Dispatch
- Reducers
- Store / Provider / Connect

## Getting Started

To get started, copy your code from the previous part into a new repository.

## Acceptance Criteria

Look at the Rubric Below.

### Technical Details

- Conceptually, all of the business logic contained in your event handler functions will now become action creator functions. One exception to be careful of is the handleCreate event handler; there is an if statement that checks whether the key pressed was an Enter key or not. That logic should stay in your handleCreate event handle because it is logic directly related to handling the DOM event. However, all the other code is business logic that can be moved to an action creator function that could be called addTodo.

- Every action creator will have an associated action type constant. For example, the addTodo action creator will return an action object whose type property will be ADD_TODO.

- Some event handler methods had to be passed down as props two times. For example, the handleDelete handler was defined in the App component and it was passed down to TodoList and then passed down again to TodoItem. With Redux, we do not have to pass down props multiple times. You should only have to pass down props a maximum of one time.

- You can achieve this by using connect to connect any component to read data from the redux store (via mapStateToProps) or to fire an action creator (via mapDispatchToProps).

### Submission

You will be required to submit a deployed application. If you instead submit a link to a repository (that is, only code), you will be awarded 0 points.
